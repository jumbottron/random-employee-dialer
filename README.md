# Random Employee Dialer

This repository contains the code and setup instructions for a random employee dialer system using AWS services.

## Project Goal

This idea was mentioned to me by a co-worker and I was curious if I could create a functional dialer project with ChatGPT using as few prompts as possible to get a working POC

This has yet to be tested as I spent time just building out the project and wiki for practice as it has been a while since I have been active on git. I will remove this message after I have a chance to follow the directions and can confirm whether or not this thought exercise produced valid results.
